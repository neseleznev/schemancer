/**
 * This notification can be sent by either side to indicate that it is cancelling a previously-issued request.
 * 
 * The request SHOULD still be in-flight, but due to communication latency, it is always possible that this notification MAY arrive after the request has already finished.
 * 
 * This notification indicates that the result will be unused, so any associated processing SHOULD cease.
 * 
 * A client MUST NOT attempt to cancel its `initialize` request.
 * 
 * For task cancellation, use the `tasks/cancel` request instead of this notification.
